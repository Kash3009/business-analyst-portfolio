## Health Risk Analytics & Decision Support Case Study

**Context:** Academic–to–Industry Analytics Case Study  
**Tools used:** R, RMarkdown, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  
**Focus areas:** Data analysis, decision support, governance, risk, explainable analytics

**Business problem**  
Early identification of heart disease risk is often limited by inaccessible, non-transparent clinical tools. The objective was to design an interpretable, data-driven decision support model that could help individuals and practitioners assess risk while remaining explainable, auditable, and ethically responsible.

**What I did**
- Framed the problem from a stakeholder and decision-making perspective rather than a purely technical one
- Cleaned, explored, and analysed structured health data to identify key risk drivers
- Built interpretable predictive models (logistic regression and decision trees) prioritising transparency over black-box accuracy
- Designed a user-facing self-assessment logic translating model outputs into clear risk categories
- Documented assumptions, limitations, and bias considerations to support responsible use

**Key insights & outcomes**
- Identified age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and exercise-induced angina as primary risk drivers
- Delivered a transparent model suitable for regulated or high-trust environments
- Demonstrated how analytics can support early risk awareness rather than automated diagnosis
- Balanced predictive performance with explainability and governance requirements

**Governance & ethics considerations**
- Applied CRISP-DM methodology for structured analytics delivery
- Addressed data privacy, bias testing, and ethical constraints aligned to Australian Privacy Principles
- Designed outputs to support decision-making, not replace professional judgement

**Deliverables**
- Full analytical report (PDF)
- Reproducible RMarkdown analysis
- Presentation slides summarising insights for non-technical audiences
